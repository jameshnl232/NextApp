## <a name="tech-stack">‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack</a>

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (v15)**: A React-based framework that provides hybrid static & server rendering, file-based routing, and more. Next.js powers the core structure of this app and handles server-side rendering for enhanced SEO and performance.
- **React (v19.0.0)** & **React DOM**: React serves as the backbone of the UI layer, managing the component lifecycle and rendering, while React DOM connects it to the browser.
- **[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)**: A library for building accessible and high-quality UI components. We're using several Radix components, including Avatar, Icons, Slot, and Toast for a consistent UI experience.
- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** & **React Three Fiber**: These libraries are used for creating 3D graphics in the app, with `@react-three/drei` providing utility components to simplify the Three.js experience.
- **Tailwind CSS** & **Tailwind Merge**: Tailwind is used for styling, allowing for rapid and responsive design, with `tailwind-merge` helping to manage conflicting class names for a clean codebase.
- **Styled Components**: A CSS-in-JS library that enables the creation of styled React components. It works alongside Tailwind CSS for complex styling needs.
- **Lucide Icons**: A library for modern, customizable icons, contributing to the app's visual clarity and appeal.

## Content Management & Backend Integration

- **Sanity CMS**: This headless CMS powers content management for the application, with tools like `@sanity/image-url` for image management and `sanity-plugin-markdown` to support Markdown content.
- **Sentry**: An error-tracking tool for capturing and monitoring issues in real-time, ensuring we can address bugs swiftly in both production and development.

## Authentication

- **NextAuth.js (v5 beta)**: NextAuth handles user authentication, providing a secure and flexible solution for managing user sessions within a Next.js environment.

## Utility Libraries

- **Markdown-It** & **EasyMDE**: These libraries enable Markdown support for text formatting and editing within the application, ensuring content is presented clearly.
- **clsx**: A utility for managing conditional class names, enhancing the readability and maintainability of the component styling.
- **Slugify**: Used for creating URL-friendly slugs from content titles, improving the SEO and readability of URLs.

## Development Tools

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript enhances the development experience by adding static typing to JavaScript, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.
- **ESLint**: ESLint is set up to enforce code quality and consistency, with specific configurations for Next.js projects.
- **PostCSS**: PostCSS processes stylesheets and integrates seamlessly with Tailwind CSS for efficient styling.
- **Dev Dependencies**: Additional type definitions for libraries like `markdown-it`, `node`, `react`, and `react-dom` ensure TypeScript compatibility across the application.
